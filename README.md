## 🔍 Key Learnings

- Password strength improves with:
  - **Length ≥ 12 characters**
  - Use of **uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters**
  - Avoiding dictionary words and patterns
- **Passphrases** (e.g., `Purple!Dog3Likes_Tea`) are both strong and memorable.
- Avoid reusing passwords across sites.

---

## 🛡 Common Attacks

- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all character combinations.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses a list of common passwords and words.
- **Credential Stuffing**: Uses leaked credentials on multiple sites.
